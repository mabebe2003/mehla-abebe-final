    Why a single shortest-path run from S is not enough:
  A single shortest path run from S is not enough because the algorithm 
  must make the decision of not only getting from S to T with minimum fuel cost 
  but also travel through specific nodes (the chambers) before reaching T.

    What decision remains after all inter-location costs are known:
  How can the engine run from S to T while entering all nodes in M 
  atleast once with the minimum cost ?  

    Why this requires a search over orders (one sentence):
  Different order of nodes must be searched to find the most optimal path 
  that reduces the fuel cost. """
